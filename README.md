### Docker

Docker is a platform and set of tools designed to facilitate the creation, deployment, and running of applications in lightweight, portable containers. Containers allow developers to package an application and its dependencies, including libraries and other components, into a single, standardized unit. This unit can then be easily moved between different environments, such as development, testing, and production, without worrying about differences in the underlying infrastructure.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes provides a powerful and flexible platform for container orchestration, allowing you to deploy and manage applications seamlessly across a cluster of machines.
